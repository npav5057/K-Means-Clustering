# Image-segmentation using K-Means Algorithm
Implementation of K-Means Algorithm for Image-segmentation and Compression.

## Dependencies
##### Python3
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install Pillow
```
## Result
This is an example of the application of the K-Means Clustering Algorithm to Image-segmentation showing initial image together with their K-means segmentations obtained using various values of K.
This ilustrates that smaller values of K give higher compression at the expense of poorer quality of image.
